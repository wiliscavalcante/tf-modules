Subject: Important Update: URL Correction for Web Crawling

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to inform you of a recent development regarding our web crawling activities within our Business Unit (BU).

We utilize web crawlers to gather data from governmental websites, and unfortunately, the provided instructions initially specified "http" URLs instead of the more secure "https" protocol. This unintentional oversight triggered an alert that has been brought to our attention.

To swiftly address this matter, we have taken immediate action. All URLs associated with our web crawling operations have been promptly updated from "http" to "https." This corrective action aligns our data collection practices with the highest security standards, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the information we acquire.

Rest assured, we take data security seriously and have acted promptly to eliminate any potential vulnerabilities in our processes.

Should you have any questions or require further details, please don't hesitate to contact us. We greatly appreciate your understanding and cooperation as we work diligently to maintain the quality and security of our data gathering efforts.

Thank you for your ongoing support.

Best regards,
